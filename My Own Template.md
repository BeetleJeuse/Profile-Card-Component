### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

CSS

  - From this video, I learned I can simply use a negative margin to push my image 50% into the top bubbly image instead of setting positions to relative and absolute like I did, plus my way was more time consuming. 

<> Same video, This Css code: background-position: right 50vw bottom 50vh, left 50vw top 50vh;
- Use comma to separate multiple images positioning
- Its X first and then Y, so left/right and then top/bottom
- Its x amount of space from whatever side you want to use. So, right 50vw bottom 50vh, is 50vw from the right and 50vh from the bottom for ex. 



### Continued development

I learned how to add two images to a background but could not figure out how to space them correctly. I will use youtube for this part. I need to learn more on backgrounds because I still have trouble here.

I used this video to learn how to do the background. Everything else I was finally able to do by myself :)
